# My Exercism Challenge

Every night, whenever I was alone with my tinnitus, whenever I was sleepless, I
was at my computer and tried to solve a puzzle each day. Some of them took days;
some were very easy.

The challenge is not over yet, and I think it will continue for a while
too. Sometimes old questions are updated, Exercism contributors continue to add
new unit tests. I see my mistakes when I go back and review my solutions. So,
after solving all the puzzles, I will continue to look from time to time.

I do not think about adding a language more. These three languages (Rust, Dart,
and Lisp) is pretty fun and instructive for me. Please **do not open** a
pull-request. You can fork, but I think it will be more fun for you to start
from scratch.
